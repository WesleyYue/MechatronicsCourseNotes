## 16.2 - 16.7

### Freebody Diagram Equation

> Draw a free body diagram of the applied forces, and equate that to the effective forces (one force vector and one moment vector)

### Plane Motion of Rigid Body

> 1. Translation
>   * only $m|overline{a}$
> 2. Centroidal
>   * only $\overline{I}\alpha$
> 3. Genearl Plane Motion
>   * $m\overline{a}$ and $\overline{I}\alpha$

### Plane Motion of System of Rigid Bodies

> Draw FBD with all rigid bodies in the system. Omit forces between each body since it is internal to the system.
> 1. < 3 unknowns - Use $\sum F_x, \sum F_y, \sum M$
> 2. > 3 unknowns - Seperate FBD for each body. Include internal equal and opposite forces.
