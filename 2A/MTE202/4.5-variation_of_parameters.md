# Chapter 4.5 Variation of Parameters (4.6 in book)

### MUC, but for **variable** coefficients

> To solve a 2<sup>nd</sup> order ODE: $\quad y'' + p(t)y' + q(t)y = F(t)$
$$
y_{general} = y_{homogeneous} + y_{particular} \\
y_h(t) = c_1y_1(t) + c_2y_2(t)\\
y_p(t) = v_1(t)y_1(t) + v_2(t)y_2(t)
$$
To find $y_1$ and $y_2$, use aux. equations.
To find $v_1(t)$ and $v_2(t)$, solve the system:
$$
y_1v_1' + y_2v_2' = 0 \\
y_1'v_1' + y_2'v_2' = \frac{f}{a}
$$
<small>*$a$ here is the coefficient for the second order term in the ODE, however, it seems in JP Hickey's notes the second order term coefficient is always 1. The variable coefficients only seem to be for the first and zeroth order term ($p(t)$ and $q(t)$).*</small>


> #### Method of Variation of Parameters
> For a $2^{nd}$ order ODE: $$ay'' + by' + cy = f$$
> 
> **a)** Find linearly independent solutions $\{y_1(t), y_2(t)\}$ to the homogenous equation 
> $$ay'' + by' + cy = 0$$
> **b)** Determine $v_1(t)$ and $v_2(t)$ by solving:
> $$
v_1(t) = \int\frac{-f(t)y_2(t)}{a[y_1(t)y_2'(t) - y_1'(t)y_2(t)]}dt \quad(1)
 \\
v_2(t) = \int\frac{f(t)y_1(t)}{a[y_1(t)y_2'(t) - y_1'(t)y_2(t)]}dt \quad (2)
$$
> *<small>Can drop constant terms from integrating since you only need one solution. (See textbook; Hickey does this in a roundabout way in his notes by collecting all the terms and redefining the constant coefficients.) </small>*
> **c)** Solve $y_p(t) = v_1(t)y_1(t) + v_2(t)y_2(t)$ for $y_p(t)$

> Helpful Identities
> $$
cos^2x + sin^2x = 1 \quad (1)\\
tan\theta = \frac{\sin\theta}{\cos\theta} \quad (2)\\
\int sec(t) = ln|sec(t) + tan(t)| + C\\ 
\int tan(t) = ln|sec(t)| +C
